# Types of Interviews To Expect

**The traditional job interview** is generally conducted in person, with one interviewer, at the employer's offices.

However, there are a number of other types of interview scenarios that you must be prepared for. Here's a breakdown:

**Telephone interviews** are usually used to **screen candidates** early in the process, though it is not unheard of to hire someone on the basis of a telephone interview.

Generally, companies and recruiters rely on phone interviews to identify suitable candidates and _eliminate unqualified applicants_, especially when the job seeker and interviewer are located in different cities.

With many companies, in order to get invited to an in-person interview, you **must impress** them on the phone.

Some job seekers feel that a phone interview is easier and less nerve-wracking than a face-to-face meeting because you can focus on your answers and not worry about your physical presentation.

For others, the phone interview forces them to work without the benefit of eye contact and body language that help them connect with an interviewer.

Whatever your opinion, it's important to **treat a phone interview as seriously** as you would treat an in-person interview.

**Just because it's a phone call doesn’t make it a casual conversation. Be prepared.**

This is often your _first chance_ to impress. You have to train for the semifinals if you want to play in the big game, _right?_

**Here are some tips to improve your phone interview prowess:**

**Select a time when you won’t be interrupted** and find a quiet place away from crying babies, barking dogs, and the distant sound of Netflix.

Turn off the ringers, bells, and alerts on your gadgets.

**Shut down your email and other distractions.** This is not a time to multi-task. Stay focused on the conversation.

Make sure you choose a location with great phone reception or use a land line _(if possible)_ to prevent connection issues.

**Tip:** _During your job search, make sure that your voice mail greeting is professional and appropriate if you want to make the right impression when employers and networking contacts call you._

**Arrange all of the documents** that you'll need within easy reach — résumé, notes, job description. You might also keep your interview stories and your list of strengths and accomplishments handy for reference. One of the benefits of a phone interview is that you can check your notes without the interviewer knowing.

**Enunciate**, keep your answers short, and don’t be afraid of pauses. Because you can't see your interviewer, it may be more difficult to tell how they are responding. Many interviewees start babbling to compensate. Don't do it.

Often, a pause just means the interviewer is making a note, searching for their next question or waving at a colleague. If the pause continues, it's perfectly fine to ask something like: _"Can I provide any additional details on that point?"_

**Smile and gesture** as if you were speaking with someone face-to-face. This will help infuse energy and personality into your voice, which is the only thing your telephone interviewer really has to judge you by at this point.

For this reason, you may also want to take the time to dress professionally for the call to ensure that you are mentally in interview mode.

**Don’t interrupt** questions or observations, but employ active listening techniques, saying “I see” during pauses, for example, and offering brief acknowledgements to comments.

**Many of your job interviews will be in-person conversations** -- just you and your interviewer in an office or conference room.

Often, you will be asked to meet separately with **multiple interviewers** during a single visit to the employer's offices. This is a good sign. Someone has decided it's worth making time for you on multiple executive schedules.

It's important to **prepare for each** of the scheduled interviews. Find out as much as you can about each of the interviewers and the order of the meetings.

Your recruiter or human resources contact should be able to provide you with some information.

You will learn more about preparing for and acing the face-to-face interview in the following modules.

However, there are some special considerations when meeting with a series of one-on-one interviewers:

Remember to **tailor your responses** for each interviewer. Try to understand each questioner's role in the hiring process and perspective on the position.

Don't be afraid of **repetition**. Each interview is a new conversation. Don't gloss over important points because you've already made them with other people.

Keep in mind that you'll have to present your key accomplishments and strengths to each of the interviewers.

Make an effort to keep your **energy up.** Get up and stretch your legs between sessions. Don't be afraid to ask for a glass of water or for a restroom break.

If one meeting doesn't go well, shake it off and start fresh. Not everyone is going to love you, but you can still land the job if you win over the key decision makers.

**Be prepared for changes** in the schedule. A scheduled interviewer may be unexpectedly unavailable or may be running late.

If a new interviewer is suddenly added to the schedule, that's a sign that things are going well and the company wants to fit in meetings with as many decision makers as possible while you're there.

Frequently, employers are now conducting **interviews** via video conference, especially first-round interviews.

Since everyone got comfortable with video meeting platforms like Zoom and Google Meet during the pandemic, video interviews are **now a standard part of the hiring process. In some cases, all interview rounds are conducted via video.**

For some, the prospect of a video interview may seem more stressful than a face-to-face because there is no personal contact, even though you are dealing with a real-time image and voice.

_However, with our tips and a few practice sessions, you'll soon be comfortable with the video interview format._

**Prepare for your video interview** as you would for a face-to-face interview. Dress in your interview best.

**Test your webcam** and video meeting setup well in advance of your interview. Make sure that you have installed any necessary software and do a run-through with a friend if you're using an unfamiliar platform.

This will allow you to get comfortable with the interface and make sure that your webcam, microphone, and headset or speakers are working. A quality headset may be a worthwhile investment if you don't have one.

**Choose a location** with a neutral and uncomplicated background, then turn on your webcam to see how you'll look to the interviewer. You can adjust your webcam to find the angle and distance that feels most comfortable.

**Find a private spot** for conducting the interview, preferably a room with a door that closes and locks. You don't want your roommate or cat wandering into the frame when you're in mid-interview. Adjust the lighting to avoid too much glare or shadow.

**Make sure you have a steady and reliable internet connection.** Keep the interviewer's phone number handy in case of technical difficulty on either side of the interview.

**Keep important things nearby.** Arrange your resume, notes, and other materials nearby. Prepare sufficiently so that you won't need your notes as a crutch, but it reassures some people to have them at hand just in case. This is one way to make a video interview more comfortable than a face-to-face meeting.

**Making eye contact** is a bit different via video conference. You'll want to practice a bit with our Practice Interview tool to get the hang of it. Generally, video conferencing uses a format that displays both your own image and that of your interviewer. You can sometimes adjust settings to make the other person's image bigger than yours, which can be better for those who might get distracted by seeing themselves on camera.

Your best bet is to try to position the window on your screen so that the video image of your interviewer is near your webcam. This way, you can make fairly natural eye contact with your interviewer's video image while also looking into the camera.

As a result, you will appear to be looking straight out at the interviewer from her screen. If this isn't technically possible for you, you can try looking into the web cam when you speak instead. This may feel more awkward for you but will come across as eye contact to the other person.

If you're new to video interviews, it's **important to practice** so you don't seem jittery and unprepared during the actual interview. As with in-person interviews, your eye contact should be steady and natural. There's no need to stare into the webcam and it's perfectly okay to glance down or at the screen when the interviewer is speaking.

**Get comfortable seeing yourself on camera.** The picture-in-picture format can be distracting if you're not prepared.

If you hate watching yourself on video, you'll have to learn how to tune out your own image and avoid obsessing over how you look. The time for that is during your webcam practice session.

Some video conference services allow you to minimise your own image and view only the interviewer. That may be a good solution as long as you practice in advance and know how to minimize without interrupting the session or causing any other unintended consequences.

**Shut down other applications** and any alarms, alerts, or ringers. Also, remember to avoid distracting sounds a microphone would pick up, such as shuffling papers or fidgeting.

The panel interview may be the **most intimidating**, because you know you'll be outnumbered.

There may be some gamesmanship afoot to trip you up and see how you respond under pressure. However, the panel's collective interest is to hire the best person for the job.

You will be bombarded with questions from each panel member, each pertaining to the unique interests and attitudes of the questioner.

Chances are, no matter how much you have prepared, you are not going to be everyone’s favourite candidate.

Your goal is to be the **consensus choice**, but aim high and try to win all of them over.

**Who will be on the panel?** The immediate department head or superior is going to be there, probably with his boss. A top executive, possibly even the CEO, may participate. You may also encounter a senior human resources manager and representatives from other departments or divisions that will work closely with you if hired. If the position available is higher than mid-management, there may be a peer at a comparable executive level to the offered position.

In a panel interview, you must remember to **maintain eye contact** with the person asking the question, sweeping the room periodically like a panning camera lens and connecting with others as you respond.

**Questions may be rapid-fire**, but don't let that throw you off. Enunciate and pace yourself. Pause to consider and form responses as needed. This approach will make you seem more confident and in control.

Your pre-interview **research is even more critical** when preparing for a panel interview. Ask who will be taking part when the panel interview is scheduled and find out as much as you can about their backgrounds and current roles. This will help you understand who may be asking what and how you might be able to find common ground with each.

**Remembering names is important**, so take advantage of introductions to say each panellist's name when you shake hands and make initial eye contact. This will help etch their names into your memory when the questioning starts. Remembering each name is particularly critical at the end of the interview when you thank each participant by name with a handshake.

In a group job interview, **multiple candidates** are assembled for a group discussion and/or to perform an exercise. Often, this is a case study or hypothetical scenario to analyse.

However, group interviews have also cantered around team presentations, competitive Q\&A, and even Lego building.

These interviews are designed to evaluate how you work in a team and/or competitive situation.

You will be **observed and evaluated** during the exercise and then interviewed about your experience (either one-on-one or in the group environment).

Afterwards, you will usually be **asked about** the group's overall experience, your role, and your teammates' contributions.

Don't hesitate to **step up and participate.** A group interview may feel somewhat unnatural, but do your best to show what you can do. If you hang back, you may be overlooked. That doesn't mean you should try to dominate the group, but, by all means, take an active role.

**Analyse the job description** to understand the most important qualifications for this job. Demonstrate the qualities emphasised in the job description when performing your group task. If the job demands leadership skills, take a lead role in the task. If the position requires conflict resolution abilities, show your skills as a mediator.

When you are interviewed about your experience with the group, **show your analytical skills** by thoughtfully evaluating what went well and what could have been better. Keep your answers positive and avoid personal critiques of team members. The interviewers will be trying to understand how you think and how you interact with others.
