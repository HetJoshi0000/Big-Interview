**Let's take a moment here for a high-level overview of job interview best practices we will be teaching you how to master:**

### <mark style="color:green;">**1. Never lie in a job interview.**</mark> <a href="#1" id="1"></a>

That doesn't mean that you have to **advertise** your weaknesses. We will teach you how to handle difficult questions, re-frame negatives, and accentuate the positives.

However, we won't teach you how to lie. Interviewers are good at sniffing out dishonesty and lies are likely to come back to haunt you.

### <mark style="color:green;">**2. Always answer the question asked.**</mark> <a href="#2" id="2"></a>

It's fine to also use a question as an opportunity to bring up or **reinforce a point** that you'd like to make.

However, avoiding a question may arouse suspicions that you're trying to hide something.

### <mark style="color:green;">**3. Personality does matter...**</mark> <a href="#3" id="3"></a>

...but not everyone is looking for a sparkling conversationalist. **Chemistry is key** in a team environment, and attention will be paid to how you are likely to fit in with others.

Be the most confident version of yourself possible (Big Interview will help you figure out exactly what this means for you).

### <mark style="color:green;">**4. Don’t be afraid to talk...**</mark> <a href="#4" id="4"></a>

...but be concise. **Don’t ramble.** Don't go beyond two minutes on any single answer unless you are asked for more information.

### <mark style="color:green;">**5. Always come across as interested.**</mark> <a href="#5" id="5"></a>

**Show enthusiasm** for the job and company. They want you to be as inquisitive about them as they are about you.

Asking questions is always a plus, as long as they are professional and relevant.&#x20;

### <mark style="color:green;">**6. The key to all questions...**</mark> <a href="#6" id="6"></a>

...prior to closing the deal is **what you can do for them**, not what they can do for you. You want to excel in the role, take on new challenges, and grow with the company.

You want to contribute, work hard, and make your interviewer's job easier. You can ask about vacation time, bonus structure and dress code after they make an offer.&#x20;

### <mark style="color:green;">**7. Be prepared to tell stories...**</mark> <a href="#7" id="7"></a>

...about your work experience, but keep them **short and concise.** Preparation will help you tighten and refine your stories.

You absolutely cannot prepare too much. However, you also don't want to sound too rehearsed. Practice, but don't memorise responses word for word.

### <mark style="color:green;">**8. Think about how you use “I" and “we.”**</mark> <a href="#8" id="8"></a>

Interviewers need to know that you can **work well on a team**, but they will also be interested in your individual contributions. In other words, “I” was able to do this and this helped the team, or “we,” to achieve success.

As a manager claiming success stories, recognise team members for their strengths but accent how you were able to harness them and put them to their most effective use.&#x20;

### <mark style="color:green;">**9. Future performance...**</mark> <a href="#9" id="9"></a>

...can be predicted by past behaviour, so you should always be **thinking of how the job you are seeking applies to the example you are sharing**, the story you are telling.&#x20;

If they ask you about mistakes or failures, position your answer to convey how you learned and grew from the experience and will never make a similar mistake again.&#x20;

### <mark style="color:green;">**10. If you are asked about personal interests...**</mark> <a href="#10" id="10"></a>

...and hobbies, choose to share examples that are interesting and **demonstrate positive qualities** that can be applied to work. For example, your love of travel shows that you are adventurous and adaptable.

Your charity work demonstrates a thoughtful nature and ability to multitask. Your love of collecting porcelain frogs may be better left unexpressed.

### <mark style="color:green;">**Bonus 11. Always follow up within 24 hours...**</mark> <a href="#11" id="11"></a>

...of the interview, thanking interviewers for their time and stating how you enjoyed the experience and are excited about the prospects of working for the company.

Email is fine for this, but a handwritten note might help you stand out with some interviewers. Remember to **proofread carefully** for typos and grammatical gaffes.
