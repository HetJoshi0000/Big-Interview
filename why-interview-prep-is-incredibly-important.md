# Why Interview Prep is Incredibly Important

**The most qualified** candidate doesn't always get the job. In addition to the right qualifications and background, you'll need solid interviewing skills in order to compete in today's job market.

#### **You Stay True to Yourself** <a href="#you-stay-true-to-yourself" id="you-stay-true-to-yourself"></a>

That doesn't mean you have to become someone you're not -- _a schmoozer, a con artist, or a kiss-up._ You don't have to change your personality to interview well.

You just have to learn how to present yourself in the best possible way for each interview and how to eliminate nerves, building your confidence to allow your natural personality to shine through.

**Job interviewing is an essential life skill.** The average person holds 5-15 different jobs during his adult life.

In fact, according to numbers from Department of Labour's Bureau of Labour Statistics, 27 percent of the population with four-year college degrees or better have held between eight and 10 jobs between the ages of 18 and 42.

Change is a constant and the workforce keeps revolving. You never know when the perfect opportunity will appear. _Don't you want to be ready?_

**The skills you develop** in becoming a great interviewer will also serve you throughout your career. Interviewing helps you hone your presentation and communication proficiency, your ability to think on your feet, and your talents of persuasion.

Practice is essential, but it's also important to have the right information about how to research, prepare, and present yourself.
