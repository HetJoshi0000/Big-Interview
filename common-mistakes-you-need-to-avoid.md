Are you making any of these common job interview mistakes? Are you sure?&#x20;

**Walk through the list and double check:**

### <mark style="color:green;">**1. Not being on time**</mark> <a href="#1" id="1"></a>

Always arrive for a job interview **on time.** Being late suggests you are unreliable, disorganised or disrespectful, possibly all three. Being a few minutes early is great, but arriving more than 20 minutes early might signal that you are insecure or desperate.

### <mark style="color:green;">**2. Not doing research**</mark> <a href="#2" id="2"></a>

If you have to ask what the company does, you have probably already lost the job. Information is readily available and if you can't be bothered to conduct a **Google search**, then you probably don't deserve the position.

Human resources experts tell us that lack of research about the company is the biggest _(and most easily avoidable)_ mistake that they see.

### <mark style="color:green;">**3. Not answering questions**</mark> <a href="#3" id="3"></a>

A hesitancy to answer questions will **turn your interviewer off**, and if you don’t have any stories to tell about your professional life and business triumphs, you should sit down and come up with some right now.

### <mark style="color:green;">**4. Not being concise**</mark> <a href="#4" id="4"></a>

Having too much to say can be just as devastating. You may impress the interviewer by sharing that you went to college on a football scholarship, but you needn’t give a blow-by-blow description of your college career or the knee surgery that ended it.

**Tweak their interest**, but allow a little mystery to remain. Don’t dwell on trivial topics, because they trivialise you.&#x20;

### <mark style="color:green;">**5. Not putting yourself in the interviewer's shoes**</mark> <a href="#5" id="5"></a>

Don't focus on how the job can benefit you during the early stages. If you seem too interested in how the position can advance your career or line your pockets, your interviewer will take note and wonder if you are more **diva than team player.**

### <mark style="color:green;">**6. Not being focused**</mark> <a href="#6" id="6"></a>

Remember your interviewer's name. If you blank, don't attempt to guess. Trust me.

A bad guess will make you memorable in the **wrong way.**

### <mark style="color:green;">**7. Not being tactful**</mark> <a href="#7" id="7"></a>

Don't bad mouth your current or former bosses, even if they were terrible managers and human beings. Find a way to **keep it positive.**

### <mark style="color:green;">**8. Not being authentic**</mark> <a href="#8" id="8"></a>

Boasting about your “people skills” and being a people person is rather cliché. It is appropriate to include people skills as part of your repertoire, but boasting about how much you love people **can seem weak.**

We all have to work with people, with the exception of that guy who lives alone in the lighthouse. Get more specific about the types of people skills you possess -- mentoring, communicating, motivating, collaborating.

The same may be said about crowing about what a hard worker you are and how you routinely put in long hours. Maybe you are just slow and can’t keep up with your job demands?

If your work ethic is truly a strength that sets you apart, make sure you have an **interview story** about a time when you went above and beyond the call of duty.

### <mark style="color:green;">**9. Not following up**</mark> <a href="#9" id="9"></a>

Always remember to follow up after the interview. It is easy to rationalize that the employer should be the one contacting you with either the good or bad news, but you need to **show your interest** with a thank-you note or email before the end of the next business day.
